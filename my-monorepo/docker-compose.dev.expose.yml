# Optional override for local development.
# Use when you run backend/web locally (pnpm dev) but want to use Dockerized Postgres/Redis.
#
# Example:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -f docker-compose.dev.expose.yml up -d postgres redis

services:
  postgres:
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  redis:
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

# `internal: true` networks intentionally block host access.
# For local dev (host backend) we need Postgres/Redis reachable on localhost,
# so we override the network to be non-internal when this file is included.
